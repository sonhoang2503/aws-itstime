1) General
    - Much more like an helper script
    - Simple configuration management system
    - Procedural(User Data) vs Desired State(cfn-init)
    - Package, Groups, Users, Sources, Files, Commands, Services

2) cfn-init ~~ UserData inside CloudFormation
    - Get the user data inside CloudFormation => get the stack to the desired state
    - Also can watch the change in the meta data => run the stack again
