1) Multi-AZ instance 
    - If you choose to multi-az RDS => the primary DB instance will replicated to a stand-by DB instance
    - Using synchronous replicas
    - ACCESS VIA Database using Database CNAME (~~ DNS name) 
        => Default will be  ALWAYS point to the primary database instance/ no access for the stand by atall.
            Stand-by server is just sitting there till you have a failure secenerio with primary instance
        => When failure happen => The standby will become the primary  => need to change the DNS cname in your
                application to point the new Database DNS.
    - But backup can happen at the Standby-instance (~~ might be store at S3 )
        => No extra load on the primary

  !   
    - Synchronous replicated(~~ imediately replicate after write to primary,finish that replicate before commited)
    - Data : Primary & Synchronous replicated to StandBy = Committed (Synchronous)
    - Not freetier ...extra cost for replica
    - One Standby replica only (not used for reads/writes sit there for failure event on primary)
    - 60-120s for failover 
    - Same region only ...different AZs in the same region
    - Backups taken from standby to improve performance

2) Multi AZ cluster
    - Capable of 1 writer instance to replicate to 2 reader istance
    - Only can be 2 readers
    - Scale your reader load
    - Replication between the writer and  the readers, while data is sent to the writer and view as
        being commited when at least one of the readers confirm that data is written => its avalability
        for multiple AZ within that region .

    - Access : 
        - Cluster endpoint points at the writter . Used for reads/ writes and administration
        - Reader endpoint directs at any reads at avalible reader instance (even include the writer)
        - Instance endpoint point at a specific instance. Generally used for testing not production
                cus its doesn't tolerate the instance failure
    
  ! 
    - 1 Writer and 2 Reader DB instances (different AZs)
    - Run on much faster hardware, Graviton + local NVME SSD Storage
    - Fast writes to local storage => flushed to EBS 
    - Can scale reader for read volumes
    - Replication via transaction logs ... more Efficient
    - failover is faster ~35s + transaction log apply
    - Writes are commited when 1 reader has confirmed
