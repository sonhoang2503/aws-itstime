1) General
- Every VPC has a VPC router => Higly available
- In every subnet = 'network +1' address
- Routes traffic between subnets
- Controlled by 'route tables' each subnet has one
- A Vpc has a Main Route tables - subnet default
! Each subnet has 1 route table associate with it, by default its the main route table create by the VPC/
 if you create a route table for the subnet => it will disassociate with the vpc one

 1) Route table
    - Just a list of routes
        => Traffic leave the subnet when these route table associate with VPC route will review the ip packets/
            route the ip packet match destination in route table 
                - rules to route the more specific route = higher priority

! -Route table attach to 1/more subnets
  -Subnet needs to have a route table(default a main in vpc/a custom one for the subnet)    
  -Route table control what happne when data leave the subnet that associate with 
  -Local route always there 
  -Route works by matching the destination IP for that route it direct IP to that route
  -Route to default when nothing matches


2) Internet Gateway(IGW)
    - Region resilient gateway attached to a vpc
    - only one internet gw with one vpc
    - Runs in the aws publiczone
    - Gateway traffic between the vpc and the internet or aws public zone
