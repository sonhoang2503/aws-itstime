1) General
Things to consider:
- First thing considered when creating vpc:
        - IP range(vpc cidr): What range that vpc will use in advance
- What size should the vpc be:
        - Service has one/more ip => Use vpc space
- Are there any Networks we cant use...
- VPC's,Cloud,On-premises,Partners & Vendors (Choose range not duplicate)
- Try to predict the future
- VPC Structure - Tiers & Resiliency (Availability) Zones
- Tiers are things which seperate applications components


2) Basis
- Vpc subnet located inside AZ => First decide how many AZ your VPC will use
  !Choose 4 AZ inside region(3 is more like default , we add 1 for growth)

- So we have vpc at least split into 4subnet
- Start with 4 tier layer in your network
    - Web
    - App
    - DB
    - Spare
- Each tier will have its own subnet
