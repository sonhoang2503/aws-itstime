1) General
- Standard AWS account is not within an IAM organizations
- Use one to create an organization => That account become the management account
- Standard account joins to an organization its become an member account 
- Start with Organization root (root container for the aws account )
        - Organizational unit

- Member account consolidated billing to Management account
    - => Consolidation of reservations and volume discounts
2) Basiss
    - create new account in organization
    - no need IAM user in each account => Instead can use IAM roles to allow IAM users 
    to access other aws account
        - eg: You can create IAM role inside a account A, Grant that with trust identity by any 
        criteria(eg: we choose account id of an account B inside the organization), then you will add permission to that role. 
        now u can use that account B in organization that is trusted by the account A we setup to switch role
        to interact with service/resources of account A by any permissions was given.

3) Organizational Unit (OU)
    - An organizational unit (OU) is a logical grouping of accounts in your organization, created using AWS Organizations.
     OUs enable you to organize your accounts into a hierarchy and make it easier for you to apply management controls.
