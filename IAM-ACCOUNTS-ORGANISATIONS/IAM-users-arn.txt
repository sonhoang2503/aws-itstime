1) General
-  I AM Users are indentity used for anything requiring long-term AWS access.
-  An Identity trying to access AWS
    - An person/app make request to IAM to interact with AWS resource
- IAM is responsible for authenticate the identity before it have access the resource
    - Username/password
    - Access key
- After authenticate the identity the AWS know which policies attach to that identity so i can grant access due to the policies


2) ARN Amazon Resource Name
- Uniquely identify resources within any AWS accounts
- Used in IAM Policies attach to identity
- Format:
    - arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id
    - arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id
    - arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id
- Format difference: 
    - arn:aws:s3:::catgif => The Bucket itself
    - arn:aws:s3:::catgif/* => Objects in the bucket 
    Object in the buckets and the bucket permissions are not the same thing.


3) Rule
    - 5000IAM Users per account
    - IAM User can be a member of 10 groups
    - This has systems design impacts
    - Internet-scale applications
    - Large orgs & org merges ??
