1) General
- IAM Groups are containers for Users
- Have no credentials, cannot log in to Groups
- Solely used to manage IAM Users

2) Basis   
    - Group allow effective administration style management of users.
    - Can attach policies to group both inline or managed
    - Cannot have nesting groups within groups
    - Limit groups per account

? Policy in a resource can reference IAM users and IAM role to give the access to but
    => Group are not a true identity/ cant be reference as a principal in a policy

! Group just to group IAM users and attach policies to group so the users inherit it.
