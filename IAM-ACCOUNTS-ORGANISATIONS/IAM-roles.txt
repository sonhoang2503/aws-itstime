1)General
- Role is an identity exists inside an AWS account
- For general we use IAM User for an single Principal
- But for IM Role we can use for multiple Principal as account/app/services

2) Basis
    - A role is represent level of access inside an AWS account.
    - Can be used short times, just becoming the role, has all permissions that role has.(borrow the permission for a short period of time)

3) User vs Role
    - IAM User can have identity permission policies(inline/ attached managed policies)
    - IAm Role have 2 types of policies
        - Trust Policy : If identity is allow in Trust Policy => it will be allowed to assume the ROLE in Iam Role
            - Trust Policy can reference identities in the same account/other roles/other AWS services/also other identities in other AWS accounts.
            - If the identity grant its role => AWS will generates temporary security credentials( but the credentials is time limited)

        - Permissions Policy : 
            - After grant the credentials => these role will be able to access to the resources that is define in Permissions Policy.


? When to use IAM roles
    - If you dont know how much principals will need/ => means its can scale then you probably need to use role (5000limit user for account)
    - Grant and Emergency Role for some emergency occasions
    - Often want to used if you want to reuse your existing identities for use within AWS 
    -
    
! Access AWS resources need AWS identity
! 5000 limit user within account
