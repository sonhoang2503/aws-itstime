1) General
- EC2 instances are virtual machines(OS + resources)
- Run in EC2 Hosts
- Shared hosts(default ) or Dedicated Hosts()
- Host = 1AZ - AZ fails, host fails, instances fail
    => EC2 host run within a single AZ, AZ resilient service
       !EC2 mentions => Focus on locate AZ detail

? EC2 Host is resourced AWS create based on AZ, EC2 host (instance store, storage, data network,...) 
  => think of it like a certain type of processor/network,cpu,memory, configuration of storage
  EC2 Instance is config to get the resource from host
  => istance created with different generations to ultilize specific type of host
  ! AZ Based , eg you cannot have EC2 instance get the network data from another AZ

!Good for
- Traditional OS+Application Compute
- Long-Running Compute
- Server style applications
- either burst or steady-state load
- great for monolithic application stacks
