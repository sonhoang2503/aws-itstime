1) 
   Default ec2 instance was shared in the most sense host by aws

2) Placement groups (how we arrange instance in physical hardware)

    - Cluster - Pack instances close together
    - Spreach - Keep instances seperated
    - Partition - Groups of instances spread apart

3) Cluster Placement groups
    - Maximum performance (lauching all at the sametime)
    - Launch in single AZ
    - All instances within the same cluster placemnet group using the same rack/ sometimes the same host.    
    - ALl members have directr connections to each other => Best stream performance 
            => Using enhanced networking
    
    !Need performances => Same AZ,close together => risk if hardware fails all fails

    ! 
    - Cannot span AZs => Lock in one AZ only - locked when lauching the first instances
    - Can span VPC peers but impacts performance
    - Should use the same types of instance/ and launch at the same tim,e

4) Spread Placement Groups

    - Span multiple AZ
    - Indifferent rack in different AZ => has its own networking
    - Limit to 7 instances per Az - Isolated infras Limit

    !
    - Provide Infra Isolations
    - each Instances runs from a different rack
    - Each rack has its own network and power
    - 7 instances per AZ (hard limit)

    => Small number of cirtical instances that need to be kept seperated from each other
        better avalability resillience

5) Partition Placement groups
    - Designed => more than 7 instances in AZ but still need them to be seperated
    - Can created across AZ
    - Divided into partitions , max 7 partition in each AZ
    - Each has its own rack - no sharing between partitions


    ! Huge scale than spread placement group/
        but administrator the instances within partition

    - 7 partions per AZ
    - Instances can be placed in a specific partition or auto plcaed
    - Great for topology aware app
    ... HDFS,HBase, Cassandra
