1) On-demand:
    - default options/avg of everything
    - instances are isolated but multiple customer instances run on shared hardware
    - using per seconds billing, 
    - predictable pricing, no upfront cost, no discount
    - shortterm/ unknown workloads.

2) Spot
    - Cheapeast way to achieve 
    - Using bid mechanism to set the maximum price to purchase the spot/
    ! never use spot for workloads which cant tolerate interuptions 
        or anything long-term, require consistent, reliable compute
    - anything can be re run
    - bursty capacity needs
    - cost sentitive workloads
    - anything which is stateless

3) Reserved 
    - form a part of most larger deploymemt within AWS (long-term consumption of EC2 resources)
    - reduce/remove the per second cost 
    - purchased to lock in an AZ, a region
    - come with 1y/3y term 
        - (no upfront => reduce per-second fee).
        - (all upfront => no per-second fee).
        - (partial upfront => reduced per-second fee > better than no upfront)

    - different types
        - standard:
            - cheapest running 24/7 1-3 years
        - scheduled:
            - ideal for long term usage which doesnt run constantly (eg running 6hours daily start from 23pm)

4) Dedicated host
    - Come with all physical need of that host
    - Software license based on sockets or cores in a physical machine
    - Does not need to pay for billing/per second but need to manage resource.

5) Dedicated instances
    - Your instances run in an ec2 host (1/more of you instances)
    - NO customer use the same host .
    - AWS commit no other instances from other user to shared the host.
    - But ofcourse there are fee 
    ! Strict requirement , cannt not share infras

6) Saving plan
    - A hourly commitment for a 1 or 3 year term
        -
