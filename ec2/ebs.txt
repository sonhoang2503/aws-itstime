1) General  
    - Service provide block storage - take raw physical disk for allocations (volumes) => can be read/write from
        using a block number on that volume
    - You can encrypt the volume using KMS

    - When using ec2 instances it see block device and create file system on this device
    - Storage is provisioned in 1 AZ ( Resillient in that AZ)

    - In EBS you created then attach it to one ec2 instance/ some other service over a storage network
    - Can attach to multi ec2 instaces/ know as cluster but need to configure so it doesnt cause data corruption 
        with multiple device write
    - Can also be detached and reattached to ec2 instance
    - Snapshot(bakcup) into s3. Create volume from snapshot
    - EBS can give different storage types, different sizes, different performance profiles
    - Billed based on GB-month
