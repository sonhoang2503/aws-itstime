1) General
    - Efficient way to backup data to s3
    - Migrate data between AZ using s3 as an intermediary

2) Basis
    - Snapshots are essentialy backups of EBS volumes which is store in s3
    => Region resillient cause store in s3
    - The first is a full copy of 'data' on the volume
    - Future snaps are incremental ( change since the last snapshot)
    - Create EBS volume you can either:
            - create a blank volume
            - create a volume based on snapshot
    
    - Can use s3 to create different EBS in different AZ
    - Can be copied to another regino also'

3) EBS Snapshots/Volume performance

- New EBS volume = full performance immediately
- Snaps restore lazily - fetched gradually
- Requested blocks are fetched immediately
- Force a read of all data immediately
- Fast Snapshot Restore(FSR) - Immediate restore
- ...up to 50snaps per region. Set on the Snap & AZ


4)  Consumption and billing 
    - Gigabyte-month
