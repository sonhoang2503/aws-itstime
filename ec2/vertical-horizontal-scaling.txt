1) Vertical
    - Each resize requires a reboot - disruption
    - Larger instances often carry a $ premium
    - There is an upper cap on performance - instance size 
    - No application modification required 
    - Works for all applications - 

2) Horizontal
    - Add more instances 
    - Running mulitple applications with load balancer
    ? Sessions are everything
        - With single app the session is store in the same app
        - With multiple app, you will have different session due to the different app
        - required application support/off-hot session(session host in external like a db)
        - no disruption when scaling
        - no real limits to scaling
        - often less expensive - preminum
