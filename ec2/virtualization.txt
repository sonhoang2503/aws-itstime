1) General 
    - Virtualization is the process of running more than 1 os in the hardware

    - Hardware ... CPU,MEM,NETWORK,DEVICES,...
    - Then its come with the OS (Kernell) ~~ Privileged mode
    - The Kernell is the only part of the os can directly interact with hardware
    - Os can allow applications run in user mode /non privileged and cannot directly interact with the hardware but go through OS
            - If it tried to interact with the hardware directly => crashing the app/os

2) Emulated Virtualization
    - There is Host Operating System/Hypervisor allocated piece of hardware it needs to each of the Virtualization
        running on their own ( believe just like an normal hard+os)
    - These Virtualization interact with Hypervisor by Binary Transaltion (really slow ~~ half of the speed of the main os)
