1) General
    - Adding automation solution, scripts or other bits of configuration can be run 
        when the instance first run
    => Instances can be brought to service in pre-configured state
    
    - Outside of ec2, allow EC2 Build Automation
    - Using User Data, Access via the meta-data IP
    - Anything in User Data is excecuted by the instance OS
    - Only on Launch
    - EC2 instances doesnt interprete just run it in the OS

2) User Data key points

    - Its just a block of data 
    - Its not secure(No password/long term credentials)
    - 16kb in size
    - Can be modified when instance stopped
    - Only excuted once at launch

3) Boot-time-to-Service-time
    - AMI - Instances (minutes) + Post lauch time configuration
    - AMI - Instance (minutes)=> Bootstrapping
