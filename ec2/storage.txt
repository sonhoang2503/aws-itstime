1) Term
- Direct attached Storage - Storage on the EC2 Host (Instance store)
    => super fast(host fail => shos)
- Network attached Storage - Volumes delivered over the network (EBS)

- Emphemeral Storage - Temp Storage (instance storage)
- Persistent Storage - Permanent Storage - lives on past the lifetime of the instance (EBS)

- Block storage =>  collection of blocks present either logically as volume or blank physical harddrive ()
    - harddisk

2) Storage Performance
    - IO(block) size: Size of block of data you write to disk(16K - 1MEG)
    - IOPS: measure the numbers of IO operation can support in a sec 
    - Throughput

    Throughput = IO size * IOPS
