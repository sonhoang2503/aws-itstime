1) Single PUT upload
- Bad with single data stream to s3
- Stream fails - Upload fails
- require full restart if fails
- speed & reliability 

2) Mulipart Upload
- Data chunk up
- Min datasize 100mb for split .
- 10000 max parts, 5mb - 5gb.
- Last part can be smaller than 5mb.
- Parts can fail, and be restart
- Transfer rate = speeds of all parts

3) S3 Accelerated Transfer (Off)
- Usage of the AWS network edge locations
- There are restrict configuration to s3 bucket (naming,..)
- Instead of directly going into s3/ it will enter the closest best performing AWS edge locations 
    and after that the edge location will transit the data being upload over AWS global network (usually a direct direct network)
