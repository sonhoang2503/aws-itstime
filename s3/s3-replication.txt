1) General
    - 2 type replication
        - Cross-Region Replication
        - Same-Region Replication
    - Replication configuration from a source bucket to a destination bucket.
    - Configuration
        - Logically destination bucket to use
        - IAM role to use for replication (read object from source bucket/ replicate to destination bucket)

        - If 2 buckets in the same account you just need to add permission to the role cus the bucket already trust the IAM/ => trust the IAM role
        - But if 2 buckets in different account you need to configure the destination bucket an bucket policy to trust the role and can replicate it

2) S3 Replication Options
    - All objects or a subset ( add a filter objects by prefix or tags)
    - Storage class - default is to maintain
    - Ownership - default is the source account
    - Replication Time Control(RTC)
    - Default Versioning needs to be ON
    - One way replication Source to Destination (non bi-directional)
    - unencrypted, crypted
    - only replicate object own by source bucket owner
    - No system events, Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive


3) !WHY 
    - Log aggregation
    - Rep Prod and Test Sync
    - Resilience with strict sovereignty
    - Global Resilience improvements
