1) General
- S3 is private by default
- Only account identity has access is the account root user who of the account which own that bucket.
- Any other permissions have to be explicitly granted.

2) S3 Bucket Policies
- Form of resources policy
- Like indentity policies, but attached to a bucket.
    - Difference => - Identity Policies = control what that identity can access => can only attach policies to indentities of your account
                    - Resource Policies = control who can access that resources => can give access to other account aswell because policies was attach to the resource

! ALLOW/DENY same or different accounts.
- ALLOW/DENY anonymous principals

3) Policy Statement
    - The same with policies but also add field "Principal" => Must define who can grant the access to the resource
    - Add field "Condition" to filter the principal grant access

4) 
- Cross access between identity policies and resource policies => it means its have apply both policies.

5) Access control lists (ACLs)
- Dont care

6) Block Public Access
? S3 if configure with resources permissions will grant public access
- This will only apply to anonymous principal (wasn't an aws identity)
