1) S3 standard
    -Data is replicated over 3 availability zones in the region
    - GB/m fee, charge for transfer out/ price per requests/
    -11 9 of durability for 10 mil objects => 1 object loss per 10000years.
    -http/1.1 200 OK for storeing object
    - can be publicly access
2) S3 standard-IA
    - just like standard but storage cost is cheaper with some compromises  
        - per GB data retrieval fee, overall cost increases with frequent dataaccess
        - minimum durations charge of 30days => store for less, but the minimum billing apply anyway
        - can be publicly access

    !long live / infrequent access

3) S3 One Zone-IA
    - cheaper 
    - data only store in one az => take on additonal risk if zone is fail
    - just like s3 standard-IA
    - can be publicly access


4) S3 Glacier
    - even cheaper
    - but more expensive retrieval,longer minimum durations 90 days (even store less will still cause the fee)
    - can be publicly access

5) S3 Glacier Flexible
    - just like standard
    - still cheap cost-effective
    - but a store object in cold state(not warm/not ready to use)
        - => required a retrieval process
                    - Glacier Flexible is retrieved to S3 Standard-IA (3types due to time need to retrieve)
    - first byte latency = minutes or even hours
    - also minimum size/
    - 90days fee duration
    - cannot access publicly

    !Yearly access => i mean no need frequent access or realtime access cus can be hours for retrieve

6) S3 Glacier Deep Archive
    - compared to Glacier Flexible
        - data is not cold state => its frozen state
        - longer fee day duration 180
        - data retrieved even much longer ( firstbyte latency can be hours to days)
    ! More like a backup not so much for retrieve

7) S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    - come up with 5tier just like from S3 standard 
    - but now data store within this class can be monitor automatically moved to suitable tier due to the measure of the access
        - frequent access
        - infrequent access (30days not accessed)
        - archive isntant access (90days)
        - archive access (90 - 270 days)
        - deep archive  (180 / 730 days)

    !long lived data, with changing or unknown pattern
