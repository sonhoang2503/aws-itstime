1) Object Versioning
- Default ~~ disabled
- But after Enabled => It cannot be Disabled can again only going to Suspend state and reEnable

2) Basis
- Each Object is identified solely by the object key (uniqie inside s3)
- If you modified an object, the orginal version of that object is replaced.
- Versioning lets you store multiple versions of an object within a bucket.

3) Object by default
    - Object also have an id, 
        - by default WITHOUT  VERSIONING => All object id was set to null
        - but WITH VERSIONING => S3 will allocate an id to that object
          (eg: incase if insert an object with the same key of an existed object => 
          it will not overwrite that object but have make a new version with different id and mark as current version)
        - GET/ if request an object in s3 => always get the current version/ but can specify id to get an version of.
        - DELETE/ 
            - when you delete object without specify an version ID => s3 will create A delete marker to hidden all about 
              the object , the deletemarker can be remove to active the object again. ( soft delete)
            - when you delete object with specify an versionID => remove that version ID 

4) Facts    
    - cannot be switched off - only suspended
    - space is consumed by all versions => billed for all versions
    - only way is to delete the bucket
    !working with version is permanent

5) MFA Delete
    - Enabled in versioning configurations
    - MFA is required to change bucket versioning state
    - Required to delete version
