1)
- can be thought as an traditional firewall for vpc
- NACLs contains rules grouped into INBOUND and OUTBOUND,
- Inbound rules match 
- Rules are processed in order, lowest rule number first.

2) basis
- NACLs are stateless, not aware of the same request, just care about the inbound or OUTBOUND
    - so communication needs 1 request rule/ 1 response rule
- VPC is created with a default NACL
    - the default inbound/outbound rules have the implicit deny and an allow all rule

3) Custom NACLS can be created for a specific VPC and are initially associated with NO subnets
    - Only impacts data crossing subnet / but not inside the subnet
        => config the NACLs of both those subnets to communicate with each other
    - NACLs cannot be assigned to AWS resources - only subnets
    - Only care about ip/cidr ports and protocols
    - Use together with Security Group
