1) Vpc router
    - Every VPC has a VPC router - Highly availble
    - Move traffic from somewhere to somewhere
    - In every subnet = 'network+1' address
    - Routes traffic between subnets
    - Controlled by 'route tables' each subnet has.
    - If no route table specific for the subnet => use the vpc route table
    - A VPC has a main route table
    - A route table can be attach to one/more subnets
    - A subnet need to has a route table


2) Internet Gateway (IGW)
    - Region resillient gateway attached to a VPC
    - 1 per Region, no need for each AvailabilityZone
    - IGW can be attached to only 1 VPC at a time
    - Runs from within the AWS public zone
    - Gateway traffic between the VPC and the Internet or AWS pulic zone
    ! no way ec2 instance inside vpc gets to know any ipaddress it just route the the IGW

3) Bastion host/jumpbox

    - Bastion Host = Jumpbox
    - An instance in a public subnet
    - Incoming management connections arrive there
    - Then access internal vpc resources => essentially just an inbound management point
    - Can configure but at its core just an entry point
