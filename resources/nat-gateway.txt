1) General

?-What is nat
- A set of process => Remapping SRC/DST IPs
- Ip masquerading - hiding CIDR Blocks behind one IP
- Public IPv4 are running out
- Give Private CIDR range outgoing internet* access

2) NAT architecture

- If you have ec2/ instance can attach public IP then you need to InternetGateway(IGW) to route
  the that to the publiczone/internet

- But if your ec2/instance does not have public IP/ then you need to route to the NAT Gateway => Nat Gateway will route it to the IGW

- NAT Gateway needs to run in a public subnet => needs an IP address
    - => Need a vpc with public subnet, need IGW , subnet configure to allocate IPv4 public, and default network point to the IGW

- Nat use Elastic IPs (Static Ipv4 Public)
