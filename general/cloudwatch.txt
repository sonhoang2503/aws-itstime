1) General
- Core service, used almost by all other AWS services for maneger/monitor

2) Basis
    - Collect and manages operational data (operational data is data generated by env either detail how it run/logging,..)
    - Metrics - AWS Products/apps, on-premises.
        - Gather and store data give you ui/cmd interface/api interface to access data.
    - CloudWatch Logs - AWS Products/apps, on-premises.
    - CloudWatch Events - AWS Services & Schedules.

3) Namespace
    - Container / seperate the metric data.
    - For all AWS service the metric will be store in AWS/service (eg: AWS/EC2)

    ? What is metrics?
        - Related data point in a time ordered structure(eg: CPU usage, Network In/out, Disk IO)
    ? What is datapoints?
        - eg? We got metric: CPU Ultilization Metrics
        - Everytime server measures its Ultilization send to CloudWatch
        - Eachtime server do it and send to CloudWatch is called an Datapoint
        - Conducts of timestamp & value
        - But if all the server send the reports ? What can seperate those server ? => Dimension
    ? What is Dimension?
        - Each server when send the datapoint also need to send dimensions
        - Dimension seperate datapoints for different things or perspectives within the same metric
    
4) Alarm
    - Alarm is created and link to a specific metric
    - Configure alarm due to event in metric trigger action
