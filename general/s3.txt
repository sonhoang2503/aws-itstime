1) General
- Global Storage Platform - regional based/resilient
- Public service, unlimited data & multi-user
- ...movies,audio,photos,text,large data,
- Economical and access via ui/cli/api/http
- Objects & Buckets - store in object/ bucket is the store of object

2) Object
    - Object assosicate with a key, value
    - Value range form 0 - 5tb
    - Other info (VersionID, Metadata, Access Control, Subresources )

3) Bucket
    - Belong to a region/ Never leaves unless you configure it
    - Identify by its name/ global unique
    - Buckets can hold unlimited objects
    - No complex store structure => Flat structure ( all object stored within the same level)
    - With the flat structure there is no actual folder inside bucket(its just prefix)
    - (- hello.txt ~~ /txt/hello.txt) => /txt is just the prefix for the key of object inside bucket.
    
4) Summary
    - Bucket names are globally unique
    - 3-63 characters, all lower case, no underscores
    - start with a lowercase letter or a number
    - Cant be IP formatted e.g 1.1.1.1
    - Buckets - 100 soft limit, 1000hard per account.
    - Unlimited objects in bucket, 0 bytes to 5TB.
    - Key = Name, Value = Data.

5) Pattern
    - S3 is an object store - not file or block.
    - You cant mount an s3 bucket as (K:\ or /images)
    - Great for large scale data storage, distribution or upload.
    - Great for offload
    - Input and/or Output to many aws products. (should be default for storage)
