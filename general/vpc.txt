// Introduction
- Service you use to create private network inside AWS that other service will run from.
- Also the services you used to connect AWS private network to your on-premise network.
- Or also connect to other cloud platform.

// General
- A VPC = a virtual network inside AWS
- A VPC is within 1 account and 1 region (1vpc cannot belonged to multiple regions)
- Default is private and isolated from other vpcs/aws publiczone/internet
- 2 types => default vpc and custom vpc
- VPC CIDR (Every Vpc is allocated a range of IP address): start and end range of ip addressed that vpc can use. So anything want to 
  comunicate with that vpc need to go through vpc cidr. 
- VPC CIDR (default ip) : 172.31.0.0/16
- As we know inside Regions will be AZs => Vpc achieve resilient by subdivided in to multiple subnets in each azs (once each az fail    )


// Default VPC 
- One per region- can be removed or recreated. 
- Default VPC CIDR is always 172.31.0.0/16
- /20 Subnet in each AZ in the region
