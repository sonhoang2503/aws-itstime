1) High availability (HA)  = Minimise any outages
-aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period
(Maximum online time => keeping the system operational): eg(Think about the car with addtional tires)
Easier => just need standby physical/virtual components.

2) Fault Tolerance (FT) = Operate through faults

-is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of
  its components
(Operate through failure without any disruption ) : eg(Think about the plane with additional engine/electricity system)

Much like HA => end plus the system need to be designed to be working through failure without any disruption

3)Disaster Recovery(DR) = Used when these dont work

-set of policies,tools,procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems
    following a natural or human-induced disaster

(After the disaster process/ DR is desgined to keep the crucial and non replaceable part of your system safe)
: eg (Think about pilot/passenger ejection system)
