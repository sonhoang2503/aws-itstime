1) General
    - Ofcourse we always haves data that we want it to be secret 
    - Data could be document, image,app
    - To encrypt data we need an algo (Math to transform)
    - A key ( A secret key )
    - After encrypt  => data become cyphertext and can be sent
    - To decrypt data just need to reverse (cypher + key + algo => to data(plaintext eg))

2) Symmetric Encryption
    - Use symetric ecryption key + symetric encryption algo
    => encrypt plaintext(data) => ciphertext (encrypted data) secure to send data 

    !but the receiver also need a key to decrypt the ciphertext data to plaintext 
    => the problem come with that/ need to find a way to transfer the key to the receiver also
    => good for local file encryption /  laptop dist
    => but not good for data that need to be transfered between remote party.
    => complex and the key need to be transfered in advance

3) Asymemetric Encryption
   - Use asymmetric encryption key + asymmetric algo to encrypt the data
   - The asymmetric key composed of public/private key 
   - Only the privatekey + asymmetric algo can decrypt the public key
   - The public key of course can be public or send over with the data cus only private key can decrypt it
   - Now we elivate the key transfered problem

   => Generally used when 2/more parties are involed.
   => PGP, SSL/TLS , SSH.
   => Computational much more than symmetric 

4) Signing
   - So signing is the reverse of encrypt pretty much.
   - Lets say A,B want to send data.
   - A get B public key , use asymmentric algo and ecrypt with data => ciphertext send to B
   - B get ciphertext , use private key/asymmentric algo to decrypt ciphertext => get the data
   - Now B want to send to A to confirm but still in encrypt (cipher)
   - B now send a cipher that was sign by the private key and use the publickey to verify that .
   (no private key relvead => just public key can verify document that private key used to sign soemthing)


5) Steganography
   - Problem => if data is encrypted => it shows that it was encrypted ( cannot hide)
   => Steganography method of hiding something in something else.
   => Instead of ciphertext it could be an image (using Steganography algo to encrpypt)

   => One more layer of protection.

6) Envelope Encryption
   - Process of encrypt a key again with another key.  
        => KEK (Key encryption key)

   - KMS (Key management service) need permission
        store keys
