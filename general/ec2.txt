1) General
- Provide access to virtual machine/os/runtime env.
- Default requirement for any compute in AWS.

2) Features
- IAAS - Provide virtual machines => Instances of EC2
- Private - by default uses VPC networking. (configured to launch into a single VPC subnet , need to configure public access)
- AZ Resilient - Instances fails if AZ fails (Launch into VPC subnet/ => in a single AZ)
- Different instance sizes and capabilities
- On Demand billing - Pay what you consume (per second/minutes)
- Local on-host storage / Elastic Block Store(EBS -network storage availble for the instances)

3) Instance Lifecycle
- Running - After provisioning => Running => Can either switch between running and stopped
- Stopped - Just like shutdown => Can either switch between running and stopped
- Terminated => Removed (Cannot reversible)

=> Its important cus the charge for the instance (cpu, disk,network,memory,..)

- Running = charge all()
- Stopped = no cpu/memory/network => but still storage(EBS)
- Terminated = no charge

4) Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
=> Image of an EC2 instane 
AMI => EC2 => AMI = can use to create EC2 instance or be created from EC2 instance


// AMI 
- contains attached Permissions (control which account can/cant use the AMI)
=> Public - can be used by everyone
=> Owner  - can be used implicit
=> Explicit - can be used by specific accounts allowed

- contains Root Volume(may also other extra)
- contains Block Device Mapping

5) Connecting to EC2
