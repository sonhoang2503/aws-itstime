1) General
- Logs API calls/activities as CloudTrail Event (Action with service/resource its all log by cloudtrail)
    - => Its all CloudTrail Event (activities by )
- 90 days stored by default in Event History
- Enable by default - no cost 90days
- Customize the service/ create 1 or more Trails
- Management Events and Data Events

2) Cloudtrail Trails 
- CLoudtrail is a service to enable operational/risk auditing,.. of your AWS account. Actions taken by
user,role,services are records as events in cloudtrail.

3) Ways to record events
    - Eventhistory: default, store 90days 
    - CloudTrailLake: havent check
    - Trails: Store in s3buckets, can be delivered to AMZ cloudwatch (with these event to setup and monitoring
    solutions), can setup trails for a single/multiple AWS accounts by using AWS organizations.


!~
    - Enable by default but 90days..no s3
    - Trails are how you configure s3 and cwlogs
    - Management event only be default (operation like action with ec2/s3 bucket, interact with aws services,...)
    - Data event need to be specific configure (might be cost)
    - IAM,STS,CloudFront => Global Services Events
    - Not realtime - There is a delay
